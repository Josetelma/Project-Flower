<h1>Project Animated Flower</h1>
<br>
<h2>Creating an animated flower using HTML and CSS can be a fun and creative project. Below is a simple example to get you started. This example will use HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling and animation. This example creates a simple animated flower with petals that bloom and a stem. The animation is achieved using keyframes to gradually scale the flower up and down, giving it a blooming effect. </h2>
